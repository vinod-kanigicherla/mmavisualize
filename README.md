# mmavisualize
Created Dash app for visualizing statistics of MMA fighters computed from historical fight outcome data. 
The app's frontend was built using the Dash and Dash Bootstrap Components libraries. 
The fighter comparison page allows you to compare the statistics of the two fighters at the given time period in a table and plot how a certain statistic changed for the two fighters over time. 
The all-time rankings page allows you to see the top 10 fighters for a given stat at any time since the beginning of the UFC.


Worked on project collaboratively with @vinaykanigicherla. I worked on the frotend while he worked on the backend.
